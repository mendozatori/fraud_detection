# Credit Card Fraud Detection
I am really excited about machine-learning and decided to take on this project as the first of many to get more comfortable the models/algorithms used.

This project covers credit card fraud and is meant to look at a dataset of transactions and predict whether it is fraudulent or not. I learned alot of this from Eduonix Learning Solutions.
